<h1>Hello! I'm Tricia.</h1>
<p>I'm a junior Wordpress developer, excited to start working on projects to help
  others share their amazing-ness. (Is that even a word?)</p>
<p>I developed an interest in developing Wordpress after tinkering around on my blog,
  Mom is the Only Girl, and finding that much more interesting than actually writing.
   I began simply by searching for answers to my troubleshooting, but soon found
   myself looking for courses to grow more. That led me to Skillcrush and a web
   developer blueprint, which didn't satisfy my thirst. That's when I enrolled
   in the Freelance Wordpress Developer blueprint!</p>
   <p>So I'm at this split in my life, where I have time to put into practice
     what I've learned so far, and continue to learn more...both desires going in the 
     same direction for once!</p>
